# Making tech lives a tiny bit easier

Hubby's workplace instead of base pay raises periodically revises convoluted tier structures (hubby legit has not had a raise in over 3 years) to the point that it's hard for these guys to actually calculate what they should be paid. 

After multiple instances of "bonuses" being left off of checks, I wrote a program so hubby would at a glance know what he should make. 

I modified it so another tech who writes python could use it, and I thought I would put this on my github so it can potentially help others as well.
